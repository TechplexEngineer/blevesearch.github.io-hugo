+++

For the past few months we have been preparing a plan to release Bleve v1.0.0 and adopt Go modules. We have tried to preserve backwards compatibility from an API and file format perspective, but this will be a breaking change for traditional GOPATH builds.

Please review the details of this proposal and share feedback on this [issue](https://github.com/blevesearch/bleve/issues/1350).
