Bleve

In this talk we'll start with an overview of the functionality provided by Bleve. Next we'll look at some examples of how you can integrate Bleve with your Go applications. Finally, we'll talk about Scorch, the latest index scheme used by Bleve, and how it fits into the future of the project.
